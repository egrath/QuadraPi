# QuadraPi Case

**WARNING** Work in progress, don't (yet) print!

This is a 3D printable case for the Raspberry Pi family of SBC's. It's based on the design of Apple's 1991 Quadra 700.

Design corner-stones:

- 1/8 the volume of the original case to better suit a SBC
- spacings, roundings and other design elements as close to the original as possible (Apple Snow White Design)
- some compromises have been made to make it more suitable to 3D printing
- working front-panel switches if desired (or, if not needed, hot glue them inside the case)
- working front-panel led if desired
- no hdmi and usb-c brackets on the backside, simple cable breakthrough
- **Mapple branded!**
