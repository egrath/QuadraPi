# QuadraPi Case

This is a 3D printable case for the Raspberry Pi family of SBC's. It's based on the design of Apple's 1991 Quadra 700.

Design corner-stones:

- 1/8 the volume of the original case to better suit a SBC
- spacings, roundings and other design elements as close to the original as possible (Apple Snow White Design)
- some compromises have been made to make it more suitable to 3D printing
- Holes for either HDMI/Power cables or Adafruit 4129 and 4218 HDMI/USB-C panel mounts

Feel free to fork or make pull requests!
